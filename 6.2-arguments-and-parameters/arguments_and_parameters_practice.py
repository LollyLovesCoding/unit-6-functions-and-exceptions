# 1. 
# - Two arguments are sent to the "num_chairs" function, which are "4" and "5"
# - The parameter "tables" is assigned the value "4" and "chairs_per_table" is assigned the value "5"
# - The output is "You will need 20 chairs."
# - Removing or adding arguments will result in a TypeError since this function only takes 2 arguments.

# 2. 
def print_integer(int):
    print(int)

print_integer(5)

# 3.
def print_integers_difference(int1, int2):
    print(abs(int1 - int2))

print_integers_difference(4, 6)

# 4.
# 1. The keyword to define the function, "function", will not work. Instead, fix it to "def".
# 2. The function should take 2 arguments, so there should be a second parameter "b" in the brackets.

# 5. 
def activate_thrusters(percent_power):
    pass

activate_thrusters(1)
activate_thrusters(100)

# 6. 
# 1. The function does not have brackets, meaning it will not execute.
# 2. There are no arguments passed into the function. There should be 2: name and apples to eat.
# Correct way: e.g., person_apples("Lilyana", 3)
